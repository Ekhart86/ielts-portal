Nowadays there are lot of types music and each people can find that like him. But what things music opens for people? Are modern types of music becomes more popular than traditional forms?

Music opens  the door in another world for man. This world can exist without words and contain only sounds. Music calms or excites, makes you laugh or sad.

For example, classic music is used to treat certainly kinds mental illnesses. It helps people find to harmony with themselves. Another example when classic music turn on farms as a result cows gives more milk than usually.

I am absolutely convinced that that modern music never can completely displace traditional forms of music.

Traditional music always will remain for man more essential than modern music because it is part of the cultural heritage.
 Modern composition appear every day but after a few years, nobody remember them. Traditional kind of music, on the contrary, remain in the memory of people for hundreds of years.
 In conclusion, modern music compositions create generally as commercial projects. Their main goal is bring money. They are designed mainly for young people and do not have a deep meaning in themselves. Adult people more often prefer to listen traditional kind of music because they able understand it and enjoy it.
